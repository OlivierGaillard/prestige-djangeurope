# Installed apps

* django-favicon: with a setup in common.py to locate the "favicon.ico" file under
  "static/images". The main `urls.py` of this directory is updated too.
  
## Favicon.ico

The icon image should be expressive. Actually it is not the case, it is just a 
piece of tissue with a decoration. Better take the little african house picture.
